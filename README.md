# Manzilak Cards

Social media cards plugin for Wordpress.
This plugin is still in early stages. 
It's very simple and light weight. 
It gets all of the information from your default Wordpress settings.
It hasn't been tested enough for production.
You can try it and let me know if there are any issues and improvments you may think of.
